  A portfolio that i started making out of pure boredom in the far-sighted hope of a software engineering job, that then evolved into a full out project. I purposefully decided to open-source this website since i have done so for most, if not all my projects.<br><br>
  I personally decided to add some stupid memes to the website as to not make it boring, but this WILL be transformed into a genuine portfolio the more i learn about programming and web-dev in general

> This website, as of right now, is nowhere NEAR finished, as it is still in a very early development stage. Don't hesitate to open an issue if you see any problems with the application, i'd be happy to fix them.
